## fun github instructions

### Fork this repository 

if you do this, you can propose answers and an 👤 admin (anyone can be an admin, let me know) approve them. So, we can get a compilation of all our answers.

- Step 1: fork this repository
- Step 2: Clone the fork to your local drive
- Step 3: Make changes and update your fork
- Step 4:  when you open your fork it will tell you that there are changes that are different from the main file. Click on Contribute
- Step 4: create a pull request to merge the changes you've made and add details of what it is

Here's a good tutorial on it [Making a pull request on github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)

The fork is kind of like a branch, but for the repository not just a branch [forking tutorial by TheCodex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT8KGYVurIU)

### Or Make a branch

- Step 1: make a branch
- Step 2: clone that branch to your computer
- Step 3: make changes
- Step 4: contribute those changes through a pull request. On a branch you can also merge it yourself if you have the permissions.

On a branch you can work on the document while others are working too and then pull and merge when you are done.

### push issues

What happens when the remote main is updated and your local code wasn't updated?
`git pull` what is on the remote repository
`git merge` will show you all the changes that you choose to stay or go
then add, commit and push per usual
